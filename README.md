A personal website about me, including my resume and my other personal projects.

## Motivation
Creating this website helped me jumpstart and boost my learning about web development. As I am introduced to more tools and create more projects, I can add those to this website, as I have a place to showcase my work and provide more insight to them. 

## Tools
The tools I am used to make this website were TypeScript, HTML/CSS, and React. This project helped me go from being a novice in TypeScript and React to being proficient in them, and I still was able to learn new concepts about HTML/CSS. For styling the website, I have used TailwindCSS and DaisyUI in that they are very simple to use while still being very effective in creating an easy user interface. 

## For the future
Other than adding new projects to this website to display them, there are other features I may add to make it more interactive.
